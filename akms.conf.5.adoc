== NAME

akms.conf - configuration file for akms(8)


== SYNOPSIS

*/etc/akms.conf*


== DESCRIPTION

*akms.conf* is the configuration file for {akms}.

It is a POSIX shell script with pre-defined set of variables that may be defined to adjust akms`' behaviour.
It SHOULD NOT define any functions, variables other than those specified in this page or execute any non-trivial commands.


== VARIABLES

The following variables MAY be defined by the user to configure {akms}.

*bubblewrap_opts*::
Additional options that will be passed to {bwrap} to create a disposable "`container`" for building modules.
This "`container`" is created on the overlay (OverlayFS) of the host'`s `/` (the root file system) -- it'`s basically a disposable snapshot and {bwrap} is used as an alternative to `chroot(1)`.
+
You may need to bind mount more filesystems to the "`container`" if you have a more complicated setup, such as `/usr` and `/var` on different file systems or subvolumes.
Refer to {bwrap} for available options.
+
This option is effective only when *use_overlayfs* is `"yes"`.

*build_user*::
Specifies the system user to switch to for loading {AKMBUILD} files and building modules.
+
The default value is `"akms"`.

*disable_trigger*::
This option allows to disable the APKâ€‰trigger installed by the `akms` package.
This trigger automatically builds each kernel module with an {AKMBUILD} file installed via `apk(8)` into the *modules_srcdir*.
+
The default value is `"no"`.

*keep_uninstalled*::
Specifies whether to keep uninstalled modules in the state directory `/var/lib/akms`.
+
If set to `"no"`, the built kernel objects and metadata will be deleted from the state directory after a particular module version is uninstalled from `/lib/modules`.
This happens when the module is explicitly uninstalled from `/lib/modules` using _akms uninstall_ or another version is of the module is installed for the same kernel using _akms install_.
If set to `"yes"`, the built kernel objects and metadata are kept in the state directory, just the state is changed to `built`.
+
The default value is `"no"`.
This option can be overridden using {akms} option `--keep` or `--no-keep`, respectively.

*log_level*::
Specifies the default logging level.
Any messages with level lower than the specified level will be discarded.
Allowed values are: `"error"`, `"warn"`, `"info"`, or `"debug"`.
+
The default value is `"info"`.
This option can be overridden using {akms} options `--quiet` (sets level `"warn"`) and `--verbose` (sets level `"debug"`).

*makedepends*::
A space-separated list of dependencies (APK packages) needed for building kernel modules.
These dependencies will be automatically installed into the root overlay (or the host system if *use_overlayfs* is set to `"no"`) before executing AKMBUILD`'s `build` function.
+
The development package with sources for particular kernel is added automatically to the list and SHOULD NOT be specified here.
+
The default value is `"build-base"`.

*modules_dest_path*::
Specifies the location inside `/lib/modules/<kernelver>/` where the kernel object files will be installed.
It MUST start with `/` and SHOULD start with `/kernel`.
+
The default value is `"/kernel/extra/akms"`.

*modules_srcdir*::
Specifies the location of the directory where to look for the directories with {AKMBUILD} and source files of the kernel modules that can be built and installed.
It is not required for this directory to contain only directories with the sources for kernel modules -- directories without {AKMBUILD} file are ignored by {akms}.
+
The default value is `"/usr/src"`.

*temp_dir*::
Specifies the base location for a temporary directory where the root overlay will be created.
If the directory doesn`'t exist, it will be created when needed.
There must be enough space for installing the build dependencies (typically hundreds of MiB), unless they are already installed on the system or *use_overlayfs* is set to `"no"`.
+
Since the default location is inside `/tmp`, which is typically a `tmpfs` (i.e. in RAM), you should change it to e.g. `/var/tmp` if your system runs on low RAM.
+
The default value is `"/tmp/akms"`.

*use_overlayfs*::
Specifies whether to install the module`'s build dependencies into a disposable overlay (OverlayFS) created on top of `/`, or directly on the host system.
+
*WARNING:* This is necessary for building modules automatically using APK triggers (note: kernel-hooks use triggers too), unless you have all the build dependencies installed (i.e. no additional packages are needed).
+
The default value is `"yes"`.

*MAKEFLAGS*::
Specifies the flags to be passed to `make(1)` to build a kernel module.
+
The default value is `"-j$(nproc)"`.
